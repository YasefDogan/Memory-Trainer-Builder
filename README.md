# C#-based memory reading and writing tool
 This project focuses on developing a C#-based application inspired by Cheat Engine to understand and demonstrate process memory manipulation techniques. Throughout the project, the working principles of memory management, including reading and writing data from a running process, were explored in detail. The application was designed to interact with system memory safely and efficiently, providing insight into how values are stored, accessed, and modified in real time. Additionally, the project helped improve understanding of low-level system operations, API usage, and the interaction between software and operating system memory. This implementation served as an educational tool to strengthen knowledge of memory structures, data flow, and software architecture.
